# 🗺️ US States Guessing Game

An interactive Python game where you test your knowledge of U.S. geography.  
Using **Turtle Graphics**, a blank U.S. map is displayed, and you try to guess all 50 states.  
Correct guesses appear directly on the map, and at the end, a CSV file with the states you missed is saved.
